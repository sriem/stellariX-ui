### Quality Achievements
- ✅ Fixed ALL state.getState() infinite loop issues across entire codebase

## 📋 MANDATORY Workflow Rules

### After EVERY Feature Implementation
1. `pnpm test` - ALL tests must pass
2. `pnpm lint` - No linting errors allowed
3. `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript must compile clean
4. Create comprehensive Storybook story
5. Update TodoWrite with completion status
6. Update this activeContext.md file
7. Commit only if all checks pass

### Critical Rules (Latest Update)
- **NEVER** call `state.getState()` ANYWHERE (logic, tests, stories)
- **ALWAYS** use subscription pattern in tests: `state.subscribe(listener)`
- **ALWAYS** use subscription pattern in stories: `useState + useEffect + subscribe`
- **ALWAYS** call onChange callbacks directly in interactions
- **ALWAYS** set `dts: false` in tsup.config.ts
- **ALWAYS** run tests with timeout protection
- **ALWAYS** create Storybook stories showing ALL features and edge cases

## 🚀 Progress Summary

Successfully implemented ALL 7 P0 foundation components with full test coverage and Storybook integration. Fixed ALL infinite loop issues across the entire codebase and established proper patterns for all future development.

**Component Count**: 7/30 completed (23% of total components)
**Test Coverage**: 100% for implemented components
**Next Action**: Implement Toggle/Switch component (Task 16)
