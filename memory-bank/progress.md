## Dialog Component Implementation - Progress Update (2023-07-10)

### Completed Tasks
- Successfully implemented the core Dialog component architecture:
  - Created state layer with proper accessibility IDs and state management
  - Implemented logic layer with keyboard handling and focus management
  - Developed the component factory with proper composition pattern
- Completed the React adapter implementation:
  - Created main Dialog component with portal support
  - Implemented compound components (Panel, Backdrop, Title, Description, Close)
  - Added proper accessibility attributes and event handling

### Current Challenges
- TypeScript integration issues need resolution:
  - Module resolution issues between packages
  - External type definitions for React are missing
  - Relative path imports required instead of package imports
- Build process needs configuration:
  - Dependencies need proper installation
  - Package build scripts require testing

### Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript errors by installing proper type definitions
2. Configure build process for dialog component
3. Create tests for all layers
4. Implement accessibility testing
5. Add Storybook stories for Dialog component
