# StellarIX UI - Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Phase**: Project Initialization
- **Task**: SETUP-001 - Initial Project Setup
- **Priority Areas**: 
  - Framework-agnostic core architecture
  - React adapter implementation
  - Component factory system
  - Initial component example

## Key Decisions
- Using a Memory Bank system for project tracking and context preservation
- Following a three-layer architecture (State, Logic, Presentation)
- Using a factory pattern for component creation
- Implementing framework adapters for cross-framework compatibility
- Starting with React as the first adapter implementation

## Open Questions
- Testing strategy for cross-framework components
- Best approach for component documentation
- Performance optimization techniques for state synchronization
- SSR compatibility approach across frameworks

## Recent Progress
- Established Memory Bank directory structure
- Created initial project tracking files
- Analyzed the PRD for implementation details
- Set up development environment
- Created monorepo structure
- Implemented core architecture
- Added utility functions
- Created React adapter foundation

## Next Actions
- Complete React adapter implementation
- Create button component as proof of concept
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Add documentation system
- Implement additional framework adapters
