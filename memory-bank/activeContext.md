# StellarIX UI - Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Phase**: Testing Infrastructure Implementation
- **Task**: TEST-001 - Testing Infrastructure Setup
- **Priority Areas**: 
  - Complete testing infrastructure setup
  - Visual regression testing implementation
  - Automated CI workflows
  - Dialog component planning

## Key Decisions
- Using a Memory Bank system for project tracking and context preservation
- Following a three-layer architecture (State, Logic, Presentation)
- Using a factory pattern for component creation
- Implementing framework adapters for cross-framework compatibility
- Starting with React as the first adapter implementation
- Following headless component patterns similar to Radix UI and Headless UI
- Using Vitest as the primary testing framework
- Using Testing Library for component testing
- Implementing accessibility testing with axe-core

## Open Questions
- Best approach for visual regression testing (Storybook, Chromatic, etc.)
- How to structure automated CI workflows with GitHub Actions
- Best approach for Dialog component implementation (focus management, portal usage)
- How to implement documentation system (Storybook, custom solution, etc.)
- Next framework adapter to implement (Vue, Svelte, others)

## Recent Progress
- Set up Vitest configuration with vitest.config.ts and vitest.setup.ts
- Created unit tests for Button state management (state.test.ts)
- Created unit tests for Button logic layer (logic.test.ts)
- Added React adapter tests (adapter.test.tsx)
- Created integration tests for Button with React (button-react.test.tsx)
- Set up accessibility testing with jest-axe (button-a11y.test.tsx)
- Created comprehensive testing documentation (testing-guide.md)
- Updated package.json files with testing scripts
- Enhanced turbo.json for monorepo test configuration

## Next Actions
- Implement visual regression testing when pnpm is available
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Begin planning Dialog component implementation
- Research documentation system options
- Prepare for Vue adapter implementation
