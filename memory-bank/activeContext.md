# StellarIX UI - Active Context

## Current Status (January 22, 2025)

### ✅ Recently Completed (MAJOR MILESTONE)
1. **Complete Planning and Architecture (PLANNING-001)** - ✅ Completed
   - Enhanced plan.md with ultra-generic architecture requirements  
   - Integrated all memory-bank specifications (30 components)
   - Added state-of-the-art framework patterns (React 19, Vue 3.5+, Svelte 5)
   - Created comprehensive AI Agent Development Plan (45 tasks)
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with information sources and mandatory testing workflow
   - All planning work committed to git

### 🎯 Currently Active
**Phase**: Ready to Begin Implementation
**Next**: Execute AI-AGENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md starting with Task 1

### Critical Architectural Achievement
- **Ultra-Generic Architecture**: Designed so ANY framework adapter can be added without core changes
- **Minimal Adapter Interface**: Only requires `name`, `version`, and `createComponent` method
- **Future-Proof**: Supports frameworks that don't exist yet
- **Zero Dependencies**: Core has no framework-specific dependencies

### Immediate Next Steps (Foundation Setup)
1. **Task 1**: Clean repository and remove unnecessary .cursor files
2. **Task 2**: Install state-of-the-art dependencies (React 19, Vue 3.5+, Svelte 5, TypeScript 5.7+)
3. **Task 3**: Update TypeScript to ultra-modern configuration
4. **Task 4**: Fix core architecture - state management system
5. **Task 5**: Fix core architecture - logic layer

## 🏗️ Architecture Status

### Core Packages Current State
- **packages/core/**: ⚠️ Needs major fixes (state, logic, component factory)
- **packages/utils/**: ⚠️ Missing key functions (generateId, focus management)
- **packages/adapters/react/**: ⚠️ Needs React 19 state-of-the-art patterns
- **packages/primitives/button/**: ⚠️ Implementation doesn't match tests

### Component Implementation Status
**P0 Foundation Components**:
- Button: 🔄 Partial implementation (needs fixes)
- Container: ❌ Not implemented
- Divider: ❌ Not implemented
- Spinner: ❌ Not implemented 
- Input: ❌ Not implemented
- Checkbox: ❌ Not implemented
- Radio: ❌ Not implemented

**P1-P2 Components**: All ❌ Not implemented (30 total components planned)

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Status

### Current Test State
- **Core tests**: ❌ Failing (architecture needs fixes)
- **Button tests**: ❌ Failing (implementation mismatch)
- **Coverage**: ❌ Below targets (need 90%+ core, 80%+ components)
- **Accessibility**: ❌ jest-axe not set up
- **TypeScript**: ❌ Compilation errors

### Quality Targets
- ✅ All tests must pass before any commit
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for every component
- ✅ <10KB bundle size per component
- ✅ Cross-framework compatibility (React, Vue, Svelte)

## 📋 MANDATORY Workflow Rules

### After EVERY Feature Implementation
1. `pnpm test` - ALL tests must pass
2. `pnpm lint` - No linting errors allowed
3. `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript must compile clean
4. Update TodoWrite with completion status
5. Update this activeContext.md file
6. Commit only if all checks pass

### Information Sources (ALWAYS CHECK)
- **Overall Plan**: `/plan.md`
- **Task Details**: `/AI-AGENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`
- **Component Specs**: `/memory-bank/component-catalog.md`
- **Architecture**: `/memory-bank/architecture.md`
- **Current Work**: `TodoRead` command
- **Progress**: This file (`activeContext.md`)

## 🚀 Ready for Implementation

The project has completed comprehensive planning and is ready for systematic implementation. The ultra-generic architecture ensures maximum framework adapter extensibility while maintaining state-of-the-art patterns.

**Next Action**: Begin AI-AGENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md Task 1
