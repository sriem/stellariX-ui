## Priority Framework

Components are prioritized based on a combination of factors:

1. **Development complexity**: How complex the component is to implement
2. **Dependency relationships**: Components that are dependencies for other components
3. **Usage frequency**: How commonly used the component is in applications
4. **Implementation value**: Value provided relative to development effort
5. **Cross-framework challenges**: Specific challenges for cross-framework compatibility

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED âœ…)

### Primary Focus: Core Architecture and P0 Components

#### Core Architecture
1. **State Management System** - Framework-agnostic state management
   - Reactive state management with support for derived state
   - State persistence and sharing mechanisms
   - Framework adapter interfaces

2. **Component Factory System** - Core component creation infrastructure
   - Component definition interfaces
   - Factory functions for creating base components
   - Framework adapter implementations for React (primary)

3. **Styling System** - Framework-agnostic styling approach
   - Style definition system
   - Integration with various styling methods (CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, etc.)
   - Theme support

4. **Accessibility Foundation** - Core accessibility infrastructure
   - Focus management system
   - Keyboard navigation utilities
   - ARIA attribute management

   - Create comprehensive TypeScript types

2. **React Adapter Development**
   - Primary focus on React adapter as reference implementation
   - Ensure React hooks work correctly with the state system
   - Verify SSR compatibility

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Establish unit testing patterns for core functionality
   - Set up component testing infrastructure
   - Create accessibility testing tools
