# StellarIX UI - Project Brief

## Vision
StellarIX UI is a next-generation headless component framework that provides a truly framework-agnostic UI solution. It decouples UI logic and behavior from presentation while maintaining exceptional developer experience, accessibility, and performance across all modern frontend frameworks.

## Core Differentiators
1. **Universal Framework Compatibility**: Native support for React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, QWIK, Angular, and Web Components through a unified core with framework-specific adapters.
2. **Zero-Configuration Accessibility**: Every component is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant by default with no additional configuration required.
3. **Progressive API Complexity**: Simple, intuitive defaults with the ability to progressively unlock advanced customization.
4. **Framework-Agnostic State Management**: A lightweight, optimized state management system that preserves reactivity across framework boundaries.
5. **Styling-Solution Agnostic**: Complete freedom to use any styling approach (CSS, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, etc.).
6. **Comprehensive Component Coverage**: A complete set of UI primitives and compound components covering all common UI patterns.
7. **Developer-Centric Tooling**: Integrated developer tools, intelligent error messaging, and comprehensive documentation.
8. **Optimized Bundle Size**: Tree-shakable architecture with micro-bundles for minimal impact on application size.

## Target Developers
- Frontend developers across the JavaScript ecosystem
- Teams building design system implementations or custom UI libraries
- Developers needing to maintain consistent behavior across multiple frameworks
- Teams prioritizing accessibility and performance
- Developers preferring complete control over styling and presentation

## Core Design Principles
1. **Framework Agnosticism**: All core logic must function independently of any rendering framework.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between state, logic, and rendering.
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple APIs for common cases with the ability to access advanced functionality when needed.
4. **Accessibility by Default**: Accessibility is not an add-on but a core requirement of every component.
5. **Performance First**: All design decisions must consider performance implications from the start.
6. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce external dependencies to the absolute minimum.
7. **Optimized Bundle Size**: Architecture must prioritize tree-shaking and code splitting.
8. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript support throughout the codebase.
9. **Intuitive API Design**: APIs should be predictable and consistent across the library.
10. **Future Compatibility**: Architecture must be adaptable to emerging frameworks and patterns.

## Project Scope

The project encompasses:
1. Core architecture for framework-agnostic components
2. Adapters for all major frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, QWIK, Angular, Web Components)
3. Comprehensive component library covering all common UI patterns
4. Developer tools and documentation

## High-Level Timeline

Based on the implementation roadmap in the PRD, the project has 5 major phases:
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4)
2. **Core Components** (Weeks 5-10)
3. **Framework Expansion** (Weeks 11-16)
4. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 17-22)
5. **Developer Experience** (Weeks 23-26)

Total development time: Approximately 26 weeks (6 months)
