# StellarIX UI - Product Context

## Market Analysis

### Identified Pain Points in Existing Solutions

#### Framework-Specific Limitations
- Most headless component libraries are tightly coupled to specific frameworks
- Teams using multiple frameworks must adopt different component libraries
- Results in inconsistent behavior, increased learning curves, and code duplication

#### Setup and Configuration Complexity
- Headless libraries often require significant initial setup and configuration
- Higher time-to-productivity ratio
- Developers spend significant time on boilerplate rather than solving unique application problems

#### Styling and Theming Challenges
- Many libraries lack clear integration paths with styling solutions
- Developers must create their own patterns for styling integration
- Results in inconsistent approaches across teams

#### Accessibility Gaps
- Despite claiming accessibility focus, many libraries miss key accessibility features
- Applications built with these libraries may fail accessibility audits
- Requires retrofitting accessibility features later

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- Heavy reliance on framework-specific patterns (React context, etc.)
- Significant use of complex component composition
- Results in reduced responsiveness, especially on lower-end devices

#### Bundle Size Issues
- Individual components often include unnecessary dependencies
- Large overall bundle size when using multiple components
- Increased initial load times and negative impact on performance metrics
