# StellarIX UI - Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Phase**: Component Development
- **Task**: COMP-001 - Dialog Component Implementation
- **Priority Areas**: 
  - Dialog component implementation
  - Accessibility features for Dialog component
  - Focus management and keyboard interaction
  - Testing and documentation

## Key Decisions
- Using a Memory Bank system for project tracking and context preservation
- Following a three-layer architecture (State, Logic, Presentation)
- Using a factory pattern for component creation
- Implementing framework adapters for cross-framework compatibility
- Starting with React as the first adapter implementation
- Using Vitest as the primary testing framework
- Using Testing Library for component testing
- Implementing accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Using Storybook for component visualization and documentation
- Using Storyshots for visual regression testing
- **Always using Context7 for researching component patterns and best practices**
- Implementing Dialog component as a compound component with subcomponents
- Using portals for rendering dialog to avoid stacking context issues

## Open Questions
- Best approach for Dialog component portal implementation
- Strategy for Dialog component animations
- Next framework adapter to implement (Vue, Svelte, others)
- How to implement documentation system (Storybook is set up, but need content approach)

## Recent Progress
- Completed testing infrastructure setup with Vitest and Testing Library
- Implemented unit tests for Button state and logic layers
- Created integration tests for Button with React adapter
- Set up accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Installed and configured Storybook with essential addons
- Created Button stories for Storybook
- Implemented visual regression testing with Storyshots
- Researched Dialog component patterns and accessibility requirements
- Created creative phase documentation for Dialog component
- Defined Dialog component API design and interfaces

## Next Actions
- Implement Dialog state layer
- Create Dialog logic layer with focus management and keyboard handling
- Implement scroll locking utility for Dialog
- Create dialog portal utility
- Develop React adapter for Dialog component
