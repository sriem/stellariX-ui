### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Task 14**: Implement Checkbox component
2. **Task 15**: Implement Radio component
3. **Task 16**: Run full test suite and ensure all components work

## 🏗️ Architecture Status

### Core Packages Current State
- **packages/core/**: ✅ Fixed and working
- **packages/utils/**: ✅ Fixed with proper utilities
- **packages/adapters/react/**: ⚠️ Basic structure only
- **packages/primitives/**: Multiple components implemented

### Component Implementation Status
**P0 Foundation Components**:
- Button: ✅ Implemented with tests and story
- Container: ✅ Implemented with tests and story
- Divider: ✅ Implemented with tests and story
- Spinner: ✅ Implemented with tests and story
- Input: ✅ Implemented with tests and story (fixed readonly issue)

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Status

### Current Test State
- **Core tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Button tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Container tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Divider tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Input tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Spinner tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Storybook**: ✅ Running with 5 component stories

### Quality Achievements
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop issues in Input and Spinner components
- ✅ Created comprehensive Storybook stories showing all features
- ✅ Fixed readonly state handling in Input component
- ✅ Updated build configs to disable DTS generation

## 📋 MANDATORY Workflow Rules

### After EVERY Feature Implementation
1. `pnpm test` - ALL tests must pass
2. `pnpm lint` - No linting errors allowed
3. `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript must compile clean
4. Create comprehensive Storybook story
5. Update TodoWrite with completion status
6. Update this activeContext.md file
7. Commit only if all checks pass

### Critical Rules (Updated)
- **NEVER** call `state.getState()` in logic layer methods
- **ALWAYS** set `dts: false` in tsup.config.ts
- **ALWAYS** run tests with timeout protection
- **ALWAYS** create Storybook stories showing ALL features and edge cases

## 🚀 Progress Summary

Successfully implemented 5 out of 7 P0 foundation components with full test coverage and Storybook integration. Fixed critical infinite loop issues and established proper patterns for future development.

**Next Action**: Implement Checkbox component (Task 14)
