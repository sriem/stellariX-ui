# StellarIX UI - Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Phase**: Project Initialization
- **Task**: SETUP-001 - Initial Project Setup
- **Priority Areas**: 
  - Framework-agnostic component architecture
  - React implementation
  - Testing infrastructure
  - Component documentation

## Key Decisions
- Using a Memory Bank system for project tracking and context preservation
- Following a three-layer architecture (State, Logic, Presentation)
- Using a factory pattern for component creation
- Implementing framework adapters for cross-framework compatibility
- Starting with React as the first adapter implementation
- Following headless component patterns similar to Radix UI and Headless UI

## Open Questions
- Testing strategy for cross-framework components
- Best approach for component documentation
- Performance optimization techniques for state synchronization
- SSR compatibility approach across frameworks
- How to handle framework-specific features

## Recent Progress
- Established Memory Bank directory structure
- Created initial project tracking files
- Analyzed the PRD for implementation details
- Set up development environment
- Created monorepo structure
- Implemented core architecture
- Added utility functions
- Created React adapter
- Implemented Button component as proof of concept
- Researched component libraries with Context7

## Next Actions
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Create unit tests for Button component
- Implement Dialog component
- Implement documentation system
- Research additional framework adapters
