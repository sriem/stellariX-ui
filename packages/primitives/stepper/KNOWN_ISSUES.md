# Known Issues - Stepper Component

## React Version Mismatch in Full Test Suite

**Issue**: When running the full test suite (`npm test` from root), Stepper tests fail with "Objects are not valid as a React child" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- React adapter uses React 19 (`packages/adapters/react/package.json`)
- Stepper tests use React 18 (`packages/primitives/stepper/package.json`)
- This version mismatch causes hook errors and rendering issues when tests run together

**Current Status**:
- Stepper tests pass when run in isolation: 56/56 tests pass
- Stepper tests fail in full suite: 26 tests fail due to React version conflicts
- Overall test suite: 961/987 tests passing (97.4%)

**Workaround**:
- Run Stepper tests in isolation: `cd packages/primitives/stepper && npm test`
- Tests use defensive programming to minimize impact

**Long-term Solution**:
- Align React versions across all packages
- Consider using peerDependencies for React in adapter packages
- Implement proper test isolation to prevent cross-package pollution

**Note**: This is a known test infrastructure issue, not a component bug. The Stepper component works correctly in production environments.
